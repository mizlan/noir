Include a line "dimensions <W> <H>", which is the dimensions of the map. This is the original size. The sizing can be downscaled.

Add a line "scale <S>" which is a float or integer to multiply dimensions by. Use fraction to make smaller.

Start a new frame with "newframe"

Then some lines such as follows:

"circle 200,800 20 #00ff00"
"circle 400,600 40 #ff0000"

Only hex colors and circles for now.
